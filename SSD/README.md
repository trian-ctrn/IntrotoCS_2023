## Introduction
SSD, or Single Shot MultiBox Detector, is an efficient method for executing deep learning models on devices with limited resources. SSD models are faster and require less computational power than standard TensorFlow models, making them ideal for real-time applications.

This tutorial provides a detailed walkthrough on how to train a custom SSD object detection model, convert it into an optimized format for use with SSD,. It also includes Python code for using SSD models to perform detection tasks on images, videos.
### Using Google Colab

The easiest way to train, convert, and export a SSD object detection model is using Google Colab. Colab provides you with a free GPU-enabled virtual machine on Google's servers that comes pre-installed with the libraries and packages needed for training.

The Google Colab notebook that can be used to train custom SSD models. It goes through the process of preparing data, configuring a model for training, training the model, running it on test images, and exporting it to a downloadable TFLite format. It makes training a custom SSD model as easy as uploading an image dataset and clicking Play on a few blocks of code!

Open the Colab notebook in your browser. Work through the instructions in the notebook to start training model.
